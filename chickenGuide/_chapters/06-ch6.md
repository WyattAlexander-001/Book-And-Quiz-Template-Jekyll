Chapter 6 – Nutrition Made Simple: Feed, Treats & Safe Scraps
Keeping a flock healthy is 90 % about what goes into the feeder. Stick to age-appropriate rations, sprinkle in wholesome extras, and steer clear of kitchen no-nos, and you’ll see bright combs, glossy feathers, and strong shells all year long.

1. Age-Right Feeds
0 – 6 weeks: Medicated Chick Starter (20-22 % protein)
Stops coccidiosis in its tracks while fueling rapid growth.

6 weeks – 5 months: Grower / Developer Crumbles (18 % protein)
Lower calcium protects kidneys until the pullets’ bodies are ready to lay.

5–6 months and up: Layer Pellets (16 % protein, 4 % calcium)
Pellets cut waste and the boosted calcium builds sturdy shells. Offer crushed oyster shell free-choice for extra insurance.

Tip: High-protein brands pay off in feather quality and winter laying. Cheap feed is false economy.

2. DIY Scratch & Daily Treats
A homemade scratch mix (equal parts whole oats, cracked corn, and black-oil sunflower seeds) keeps birds busy and adds winter calories. Limit scratch and other treats to about 10 % of the total diet—more can dilute vital vitamins and minerals.

Everyday favorites you mentioned:

Cooked rice and oats

Chia seeds (omega-3 boost)

Seasonal watermelon rinds, corn kernels, lettuce, apple bits

Garden weeds and grass clippings stuffed into a piñata feeder for boredom relief

3. The “Would You Feed It to the Dog?” Rule
If you wouldn’t hand it to the family dog, don’t toss it in the run. That means no:

Citrus peels or banana skins (hard to digest)

Chocolate, candy, or anything sugary

Milk or cheese (chickens lack the enzymes to handle lactose)

Avocado pits or skins, raw potatoes, or green tomato leaves (toxic compounds)

Moldy, salty, or heavily seasoned leftovers

Good in, good out: the cleaner the inputs, the cleaner the eggs.

4. Always Provide
Fresh water—refill daily; add a splash of apple-cider vinegar once a week for a mild antibacterial boost.

Grit if birds don’t have access to coarse sand or small stones; they need it to grind food in the gizzard.

Free-choice oyster shell once they hit lay to avoid thin shells and calcium robbing from bones.

Key Takeaways
Match the feed to the life stage—starter, grower, then layer pellets at first egg.

Keep scratch and kitchen treats under 10 % of daily intake; high-protein base feed does the heavy lifting.

Follow the simple dog-test rule for scraps, and you’ll avoid most dietary dangers automatically.

Feed them right, and your chickens will repay you with strong shells, vibrant feathers, and steady production through the seasons.
