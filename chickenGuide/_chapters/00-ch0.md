#### Survive and Thrive:



You’ve had those days, right? When the sleep deprivation, the
muddy cleats, the peanut butter on the new jacket, the
homework battles, the Play-Doh in your computer keyboard,
and the refrains of “She started it!” leave you counting the
minutes until bedtime. On these days, when you (again?!!)
have to pry a raisin from a nostril, it seems like the most you
can hope for is to survive.
However, when it comes to your children, you’re aiming a lot
higher than mere survival. Of course you want to get through
those difficult tantrum-in-the-restaurant moments. But
whether you’re a parent or other committed caregiver in a
child’s life, your ultimate goal is to raise kids in a way that
lets them thrive. You want them to enjoy meaningful
relationships, be caring and compassionate, do well in school,
work hard and be responsible, and feel good about who they
are.
Survive. Thrive.
We’ve met with thousands of parents over the years. When
we ask them what matters most to them, versions of these two
goals almost always top the list. They want to survive
difficult parenting moments, and they want their kids and
their family to thrive. As parents ourselves, we share these
same goals for our own families. In our nobler, calmer, saner
moments, we care about nurturing our kids’ minds, increasing
their sense of wonder, and helping them reach their potential
in all aspects of life. But in the more frantic, stressful,
bribe-the-toddler-into-the-car-seat-so-we-can-rush-to-the-soccer-game moments, sometimes all we can hope for is to avoid yelling or
hearing someone say, “You’re so mean!”

Take a moment and ask yourself: What do you really want for
your children? What qualities do you hope they develop and
take into their adult lives? Most likely you want them to be
happy, independent, and successful. You want them to enjoy
fulfilling relationships and live a life full of meaning and
purpose. Now think about what percentage of your time you
spend intentionally developing these qualities in your
children. If you’re like most parents, you worry that you
spend too much time just trying to get through the day (and
sometimes the next five minutes) and not enough time
creating experiences that help your children thrive, both today
and in the future.

You might even measure yourself against some sort of perfect
parent who never struggles to survive, who seemingly spends
every waking second helping her children thrive. You know,
the PTA president who cooks organic, well-balanced meals
while reading to her kids in Latin about the importance of
helping others, then escorts them to the art museum in the
hybrid that plays classical music and mists lavender
aromatherapy through the air-conditioning vents. None of us
can match up to this imaginary superparent. Especially when
we feel like a large percentage of our days are spent in
full-blown survival mode, where we find ourselves wild-eyed
and red-faced at the end of a birthday party, shouting, “If
there’s one more argument over that bow and arrow,
nobody’s getting any presents!”

If any of this sounds familiar, we’ve got great news for you:
the moments you are just trying to survive are actually
opportunities to help your child thrive. At times you may feel that the loving, important moments (like having a meaningful
conversation about compassion or character) are separate
from the parenting challenges (like fighting another
homework battle or dealing with another meltdown). But they
are not separate at all. When your child is disrespectful and
talks back to you, when you are asked to come in for a
meeting with the principal, when you find crayon scribbles all
over your wall: these are survive moments, no question about
it. But at the same time, they are opportunities—even
gifts—because a survive moment is also a thrive moment,
where the important, meaningful work of parenting takes
place.

For example, think about a situation you often just try to get
through. Maybe when your kids are fighting with each other
for the third time within three minutes. (Not too hard to
imagine, is it?) Instead of just breaking up the fight and
sending the sparring siblings to different rooms, you can use
the argument as an opportunity for teaching: about reflective
listening and hearing another person’s point of view; about
clearly and respectfully communicating your own desires;
about compromise, sacrifice, negotiation, and forgiveness.
We know: it sounds hard to imagine in the heat of the
moment. But when you understand a little bit about your
children’s emotional needs and mental states, you can create
this kind of positive outcome—even without United Nations
peacekeeping forces.
There’s nothing wrong with separating your kids when
they’re fighting. It’s a good survival technique, and in certain
situations it may be the best solution. But often we can do
better than just ending the conflict and noise. We can
transform the experience into one that develops not only each child’s brain but also her relationship skills and her character.
Over time, the siblings will each continue to grow and
become more proficient at handling conflict without parental
guidance. This will be just one of the many ways you can
help them thrive.

What’s great about this survive-and-thrive approach is that
you don’t have to try to carve out special time to help your
children thrive. You can use all of the interactions you
share—the stressful, angry ones as well as the miraculous,
adorable ones—as opportunities to help them become the
responsible, caring, capable people you want them to be.
That’s what this book is about: using those everyday
moments with your kids to help them reach their true
potential. The following pages offer an antidote to parenting
and academic approaches that overemphasize achievement
and perfection at any cost. We’ll focus instead on ways you
can help your kids be more themselves, more at ease in the
world, filled with more resilience and strength. How do you
do that? Our answer is simple: you need to understand some
basics about the young brain that you are helping to grow and
develop. That’s what The Whole-Brain Child is all about.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
Whether you’re a parent, grandparent, teacher, therapist, or
other significant caregiver in a child’s life, we’ve written this
book for you. We’ll use the word “parent” throughout, but
we’re talking to anyone doing the crucial work of raising,
supporting, and nurturing kids. Our goal is to teach you how
to use your everyday interactions as opportunities to help you
and the children you care for both survive and thrive. Though
much of what you’ll read can be creatively tailored for
teens—in fact, we plan to write a follow-up that does just that—this book focuses on the years from birth to twelve,
centering especially on toddlers, school-age kids, and
preteens.

In the following pages we explain the whole-brain perspective
and give you a variety of strategies to help your children be
happier, healthier, and more fully themselves. The first
chapter presents the concept of parenting with the brain in
mind and introduces the simple and powerful concept at the
heart of the whole-brain approach, integration. Chapter 2
focuses on helping a child’s left brain and right brain work
together so the child can be connected to both his logical and
emotional selves. Chapter 3 emphasizes the importance of
connecting the instinctual “downstairs brain” with the more
thoughtful “upstairs brain,” which is responsible for decision
making, personal insight, empathy, and morality. Chapter 4
explains how you can help your child deal with painful
moments from the past by shining the light of understanding
on them, so they can be addressed in a gentle, conscious, and
intentional way. Chapter 5 helps you teach your kids that they
have the capacity to pause and reflect on their own state of
mind. When they can do that, they can make choices that give
them control over how they feel and how they respond to
their world. Chapter 6 highlights ways you can teach your
children about the happiness and fulfillment that result from
being connected to others, while still maintaining a unique
identity.
A clear understanding of these different aspects of the
whole-brain approach will allow you to view parenting in a
whole new way. As parents, we are wired to try to save our
children from any harm and hurt, but ultimately we can’t.
They’ll fall down, they’ll get their feelings hurt, and they’ll get scared and sad and angry. Actually, it’s often these
difficult experiences that allow them to grow and learn about
the world. Rather than trying to shelter our children from
life’s inevitable difficulties, we can help them integrate those
experiences into their understanding of the world and learn
from them. How our kids make sense of their young lives is
not only about what happens to them but also about how their
parents, teachers, and other caregivers respond.
With that in mind, one of our primary goals has been to make
The Whole-Brain Child as helpful as possible by giving you
these specific tools to make your parenting easier and your
relationships with your children more meaningful. That’s one
reason roughly half of every chapter is devoted to “What You
Can Do” sections, where we provide practical suggestions
and examples of how you can apply the scientific concepts
from that chapter.
Also, at the end of each chapter you’ll find two sections
designed to help you readily implement your new knowledge.
The first is “Whole-Brain Kids,” written to help you teach
your children the basics of what we’ve covered in that
particular chapter. It might seem strange to talk to young
children about the brain. It is brain science, after all. But
we’ve found that even small children—as young as four or
five—really can understand some important basics about the
way the brain works, and in turn understand themselves and
their behavior and feelings in new and more insightful ways.
This knowledge can be very powerful for the child, as well as
the parent who is trying to teach, to discipline, and to love in
ways that feel good to both of them. We’ve written the
“Whole-Brain Kids” sections with a school-age audience in mind, but feel free to adapt the information as you read aloud,
so that it’s developmentally appropriate for your child.

The other section at the end of each chapter is called
“Integrating Ourselves.” Whereas most of the book focuses
on the inner life of your child and the connection between the
two of you, here we’ll help you apply each chapter’s concepts
to your own life and relationships. As children develop, their
brains “mirror” their parent’s brain. In other words, the
parent’s own growth and development, or lack of those,
impact the child’s brain. As parents become more aware and
emotionally healthy, their children reap the rewards and move
toward health as well. That means that integrating and
cultivating your own brain is one of the most loving and
generous gifts you can give your children.
Another tool we hope you’ll find helpful is the “Ages and
Stages” chart at the end of the book, where we offer a simple
summary of how the book’s ideas can be implemented
according to the age of your child. Each chapter of the book is
designed to help you put its ideas immediately into practice,
with multiple suggestions appearing throughout to address
various ages and stages of childhood development. But to
make it easier for parents, this final reference section will
categorize the book’s suggestions according to age and
development. If you’re the mother of a toddler, for example,
you can quickly find a reminder of what you can do to
enhance integration between your child’s left and right brain.
Then, as your toddler grows, you can come back to the book
at each age and view a list of the examples and suggestions
most relevant to your child’s new stage.
Additionally, just before the “Ages and Stages” section,
you’ll find a “Refrigerator Sheet” that very briefly highlights the book’s most important points. You can photocopy this
sheet and place it on the refrigerator, so that you and everyone
who loves your kids—parents, babysitters, grandparents, and
so on—can work together on behalf of your children’s overall
well-being.

As we hope you’ll see, we’re keeping you in mind as we
work to make this book as accessible and easy to read as
possible. As scientists, we’ve emphasized precision and
accuracy; as parents, we’ve aimed for practical understanding.
And we’ve wrestled with this tension and carefully
considered how best to provide you with the latest and most
important information, while doing it in a way that’s clear,
helpful, and immediately practical. While the book is
certainly scientifically based, you aren’t going to feel like
you’re in science class or reading an academic paper. Yes, it’s
brain science, and we’re absolutely committed to remaining
true to what research and science demonstrate. But we’ll
share this information in a way that welcomes you in, rather
than leaving you out in the cold. We’ve both spent our careers
taking complicated but vital scientific knowledge about the
brain and boiling it down so that parents can understand it and
immediately apply it in their interactions with their kids on a
daily basis. So don’t be scared off by the brain stuff. We think
you’ll find it fascinating, and much of the basic information is
actually pretty simple to understand, as well as easy to use. (If
you are interested in more of the details of the science behind
what we’re presenting in these pages, take a look at Dan’s
books Mindsight and The Developing Mind, 2nd edition.)
Thanks for joining us on this journey toward a fuller
knowledge of how you can truly help your kids be happier,
healthier, and more fully themselves. With an understanding of the brain, you can be more intentional about what you
teach your kids, how you respond to them, and why. You can
then do much more than merely survive. By giving your
children repeated experiences that develop the whole brain,
you will face fewer everyday parenting crises. But more than
that, understanding integration will let you know your child
more deeply, respond more effectively to difficult situations,
and intentionally build a foundation for a lifetime of love and
happiness. As a result, not only will your child thrive, both
now and into adulthood, but you and your whole family will
as well.
Please visit us at our website and tell us about your
whole-brain parenting experiences. We look forward to
hearing from you.
