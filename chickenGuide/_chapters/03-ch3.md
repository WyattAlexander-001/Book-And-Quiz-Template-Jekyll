Chapter 3 – Chicken Life Cycle: Egg to Retired Hen
Knowing how a chicken grows—from the day the egg is laid until her twilight years—helps you plan housing, feed, and healthcare at every stage.

1. Fertile Egg (Day 0)
How it starts: A rooster mates with a hen; she stores the sperm and lays a fertilized egg.

Incubation clock stays off until the egg is kept at ~99 – 100 °F for several hours. That’s why shipping fertile eggs works.

2. Incubation (Days 1 – 21)
Natural: A broody hen warms and turns the clutch.

Artificial: An incubator controls temperature (99.5 °F) and humidity (45 % first 18 days, 65 % during hatch).

Candling at Day 7 or 10 shows a dark spider-like embryo if growth is on track.

Hatch Day: Chicks pip the shell, rest, then zip the shell open—don’t rush to “help” unless truly stuck.

3. Brooder Chick (0 – 6 weeks)
Heat: Start at 95 °F and drop 5 °F each week.

Feed: 20 – 22 % protein chick starter.

Water: Shallow dish with marbles to prevent drowning.

Milestones: By week 2 flight feathers appear; by week 4 most chicks can manage 70 °F room temps.

Integrating: Wait until they’re fully feathered (~6 weeks) before moving outdoors or mixing with adults.

4. Juvenile / Grower (6 – 18 weeks)
Often called pullets (females) and cockerels (males).

Feed: Switch to 16 – 18 % grower feed; too much calcium can harm immature kidneys.

Pecking Order Lessons: Squabbles now set the adult hierarchy.

Rooster Signs: Larger comb, thicker legs, and the first cracked teenage crow around 10–12 weeks.

5. Point-of-Lay Hen (18 – 24 weeks)
First egg: A small “pullet” egg heralds adulthood.

Nesting Boxes: Provide one box for every 3–4 hens, placed in a dim corner to encourage use.

Diet: Layer feed (16 % protein + 4 % calcium) and free-choice oyster shell.

6. Peak Production (6 months – 2 years)
Most breeds lay 5–6 eggs per week their first season.

Molting: Annual feather shed (late summer–fall) pauses laying for 4–12 weeks. Extra protein treats (e.g., scrambled eggs, mealworms) help regrowth.

Health: Vaccinations and regular deworming keep them productive.

7. Middle Age (2 – 4 years)
Egg output gradually declines—roughly 10 % each year.

Broody Urges (some breeds): A hen may want to sit on eggs for 21 days. Break broodiness if you don’t want chicks by isolating her in a wire-bottom crate for a few days.

8. Senior / Retired Hen (4 + years)
Eggs slow to a trickle; shells may be thinner.

Arthritis & Bumblefoot become more common—offer low easy-to-reach perches and soft bedding.

Final Years: Many backyard hens live 6 – 8 years, some exceed 10 with good care. Decide early whether you’ll keep retirees as pets, rehome, or cull humanely.

Key Takeaways
The 21-day incubation and 6-week brooder windows are the most hands-on phases—you’ll need heat, hygiene, and chick-safe gear.

Feed changes matter: starter → grower → layer; calcium too early harms chicks.

Plan for the whole life span, not just peak laying years, to honor the commitment you make when you hatch or buy a chick.
