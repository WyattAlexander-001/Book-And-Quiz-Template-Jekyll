Chapter 5 - Essential Equipment – Feeders, Waterers & Must-Have Tools

Chapter 5 – Essential Equipment: Feeders, Waterers & Must-Have Tools
Sturdy gear keeps your flock healthy and saves you headaches down the road. Below is the core kit—built around durable metal pieces and a few clever add-ons—that every serious keeper should have on Day 1.

1. Feed & Water Systems
Metal hanging feeder – Galvanized steel is heavy enough that birds can’t tip it, immune to sun-crack, and easy to scrub. Hang it at the birds’ back height to keep litter out.

Metal double-wall waterer – Same “can’t-knock-it-over” weight plus rust-proof if you empty and dry weekly. Add a heated base or submersible de-icer if winters dip below freezing.

Rodent-proof feed bin – A lidded metal trash can lined with a heavy plastic bag keeps moisture and mice out.

2. Storage & Everyday Supplies (park them in an old chest, tote, or shelf)
Treats: mealworms, rice, cracked corn for training and winter calories.

Crushed oyster shell in a separate dish for calcium, plus granite grit if birds roam on soft soil.

Desiccant packets or a canning-jar of dry rice to wick moisture from treats and feed.

Apple cider vinegar (a splash per gallon) for occasional water-bucket cleaning.

Agricultural lime (not caustic quicklime) to sprinkle on damp coop spots and control odor.

Poop scraper or 3-inch paint scraper for droppings boards and roost bars.

N95 respirators and nitrile gloves—coop dust is no joke.

Grabber arm to snag wayward eggs or trash without stooping.

Pinata feeder—a roll of plastic poultry netting stuffed with grass clippings or fruit peels gives bored hens something to shred.

3. Health & Maintenance Tools
Basic poultry first-aid kit: vet-wrap, antiseptic spray, blood-stop powder, tweezers.

Digital thermometer / hygrometer inside the coop to flag damp, chill nights.

Solar-powered shed lights or a rechargeable headlamp for after-dark checks.

5-gallon bucket, stiff brush, and mild detergent for weekly waterer scrubs.

Sturdy rake or grain shovel to turn deep litter and remove soiled bedding.

4. Nice-to-Have Extras
Heated dog-bowl back-up—handy during power outages.

Kitchen scale (5 lb+) to weigh birds monthly and catch weight loss early.

Dust-bath bin filled with sand and wood ash for pest control and feather care.

Extra perches cut from tree limbs—swap in when originals need a deep clean.

Key Takeaways
Go metal for feeders and waterers—the extra weight prevents spills and lasts for years.

Store feed like a prepper: metal can + plastic liner + desiccant = dry, rodent-free grain.

A well-stocked supply chest (scraper, masks, treats, lime, first-aid) turns coop chores into a five-minute routine instead of a scavenger hunt.

Invest once in the right equipment, and daily chicken care becomes quick, tidy, and—dare we say—fun.
