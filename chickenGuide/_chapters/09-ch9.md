Chapter 9 – Being Consistent: Daily, Weekly & Seasonal Care Routines
With a smart layout and stocked supplies, chicken-keeping is truly a 15-minute-a-day hobby. The secret is to front-load the planning—place feeders, waterers, and tools where you can reach them without bending or crawling—and then follow a simple rhythm.

Daily (≈ 5–10 min, leisurely pace)
Morning check-in

Refill waterer; dump and scrub only if it looks slimy.

Top off the metal feeder—shake it so fresh feed drops.

Quick headcount, quick look at comb color and activity.

Suppertime wind-down

Toss a handful of scratch, rice, or veggie scraps into the run.

Empty any obvious poop from droppings board with your scraper.

Close pop door and stroll by to say “Good night” as they perch.

Weekly (≈ 15 min on the weekend)
Wipe the metal waterer with a brush and mild soap; rinse and let it sun-dry.

Check feed bin level; restock treats, oyster shell, grit.

Rake or turn bedding in high-traffic spots to keep ammonia down.

Walk the fence line for holes or loose hardware cloth.

Monthly (≈ 30–40 min)
Full bedding swap: shovel out wet spots, add fresh shavings, and sprinkle a light layer of agricultural lime to keep things dry and odor-free.

Inspect perches and nest boxes—tighten screws or replace cracked boards.

Test door latches and hinges; dab a little oil if they squeak.

Seasonal Touch-Ups
Season	Quick Focus
Spring	Brooder ready? Check incubator temps if you plan to hatch.

Summer	Add a second waterer for heat waves; set up extra shade.

Autumn	Pre-molting protein boost (mealworms, scrambled eggs). Deep-clean coop before cold sets in.

Winter	Heated base for waterer; block drafts below roost height, keep ventilation high.

Key Takeaways
Prep once, glide daily—good layout and full buckets make chores fly.

Water, feed, scratch, “sleep tight” : the entire morning-evening routine takes under a quarter hour.

A monthly bedding flip with safe lime is the only heavy lift; everything else is quick touch-ups.

Consistency beats intensity—stick to this calm cadence and both you and your flock stay relaxed, healthy, and productive.
