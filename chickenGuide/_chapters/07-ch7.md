Chapter 7 – How to Harvest Eggs: Collecting, Cleaning & Storing
Nothing beats the moment you lift a nest-box lid to find warm, freshly laid eggs. Handle them right and you’ll get maximum freshness, minimal cracks, and top-tier food safety.

1. Collecting
Check nests twice a day (morning and late afternoon). Frequent collection prevents breakage, deters egg-eating, and discourages broody hens.

Use a clean basket or soft tote—hard buckets let eggs knock together.

Mark the date on each egg or on the carton as soon as you gather them; rotation is easier later.

Cull cracked shells immediately; bacteria slip in fast—feed those eggs back to the dog or compost pile, never to humans.

2. Keeping Eggs Clean Before They Reach You
Deep bedding & fresh shavings in nest boxes = fewer dirty eggs.

Nests lower than perches so hens sleep on roosts, not in the boxes.

One nest for every 3–4 hens reduces traffic jams and manure build-up.

Curtains or a dim corner give privacy and keep curious feet out.

3. To Wash or Not to Wash?
Unwashed eggs are coated with the “bloom” (a natural antimicrobial layer). Your approach depends on local rules and how soon you’ll eat them:

Europe-style (bloom on)

If shells look clean, skip washing.

Store at cool room temp (55 – 70 °F / 13 – 21 °C) up to 2 weeks, then refrigerate.

USDA-style (bloom off)

Wash only just before refrigeration.

Use running water warmer than the egg (100–110 °F) so bacteria don’t get sucked in.

A drop of mild dish soap or dedicated egg wash and a soft cloth for stubborn smudges.

Rinse, dry, and place in the fridge right away.

Rule of thumb: Clean the least dirty way first—dry wipe with a loofah or fine sandpaper; damp cloth next; full wash only as a last step.

4. Storing for Peak Freshness
Refrigerate at 40 °F (4 °C) or lower if washed—or after two weeks on the counter if unwashed.

Pointy end down: keeps the air cell on top and yolk centered.

Original cartons reduce moisture loss and prevent fridge smells.

Use by 45 days from lay date (commercial eggs are legally “fresh” for 30).

Water-glass or freezing whole whisked eggs works for true long-term storage.

5. Freshness Tests
Float test: place an egg in a bowl of water.

Lies flat = very fresh.

Tilts up = a week or two old.

Floats = air cell large, use only if fully cooked—or discard.

Candling with a flashlight reveals cracks or large air cells without breaking the shell.

Key Takeaways
Collect often, handle gently, date immediately—that’s most of the battle.

Keep the bloom when you can; wash only when truly needed and always with warm running water.

Refrigerated, dated eggs stay top-quality for six weeks; room-temp storage is fine short-term if the shells stay clean and unwashed.

Master these simple steps and every omelet, custard, or sunny-side-up breakfast will taste exactly like “laid this morning.”
