## Welcome!

**The Whole‑Brain Child** teaches parents how to help their children thrive by
integrating the “upstairs” logic brain with the “downstairs” emotional brain.
This site turns each chapter into a concise summary *plus* a quick quiz so you
can test your understanding as you read.

3. **Check** the *Authors* tab to learn more about Daniel J. Siegel and
