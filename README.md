# Book And Quiz Template With Jekyll
A Ruby App to show the use of Jekyll

I made this app mainly to show a working example of converting a book into a website with quizzes using Jekyll. This can be a great template to make future websites like: guides, cookbooks, etc.

To Run This App:
```bash
# Server Url Will Be In The Terminal, but it's http://localhost:4000
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
